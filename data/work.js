    description: `Here I initially worked with a team developing the widely used industry product, including IBM Integration Bus. This was a monolith system which has been in development for 20 years!

After 6 months, I proceeded to join another team in which I created fully unit and integration tested microservices - following TDD practise - for a (then) new product, IBM App Connect.

Outside of my main role, I - along with a few colleagues - setup a team to create a new project to equip the Grade II* listed Hursley House with IoT equipment which was to be used as a client showcase - and created a great working relationship with the device supplier`,
